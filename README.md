# Would you rather app
This is a game app that allows users to create polls, vote on Polls they create and those
created by others, view the results, and also view the top performing user in the 
Leaderboard.

For the selecting of formatted users, I was stuck on it for few days, but I later got a hint from @Sulenchy's Github repo.

3. Install all dependencies using yarn install,
4. In the project directory, you can run:

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
